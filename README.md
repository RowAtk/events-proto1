### User Stories

#### Creating an Event
As a user I want to create an event so that I may share my upcoming event with other users in a public space.

#### Viewing an Event
As a user I want to view the details for a single event so that I can gain additional information about an event

route: /event-details

#### View all public events
As a user I want to be able to see all public events in the system so I may browse through all event options conveniently without having to search for them individually

route: /allevents

#### Change Event Status
As an admin user I want to change the status of an event so that I can modify the visibility of an event posted by a user using my discretion.
